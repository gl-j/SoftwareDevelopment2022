****** About the contents of the folders:

-from "app" folder
"app.py" - the main python script

"LoanPred.ipynb" - is a jupyter notebook containing the code that was used to process the data and train and select the best model

"Reverse encode.txt" - is a file containing a description of the encoding of the values that take each attribute from the dataset 

"test.csv" - csv file that contains the testing data 

"train.csv" - csv file that contains the training data 

"dectree.pkl", "gradboost.pkl", "knn.pkl", "logreg.pkl", "svmclf.pkl" - pickle files that were generated based on the data processes at the "LoanPred.ipynb"

"best_model.pkl" - pickle file that was selected among the ones generated from "LoanPred.ipynb" based on its prediction score, this file is the one used by "app.py" for the predictions

"Dockerfile" - necessary for the configuration and usage docker

"docker-compose.yml" - yaml file necessary for using docker 

"requirements.txt" - file for necessary for setting requierements for docker image 

-from "templates" folder:
"about.html", "index.html", "main.html", "result.html" - html scripts that the app uses for navigating




****** For installing python and necessary libraries 
-To install python 3: 

sudo apt-get install python3.9

-To install the necessary libraries: 
*****NOTE: If you want to re-run the data processing and model training ("LoanPred.ipynb") you will need all of the libraries,
otherwise, if you only want to run the app using the previously trained model you will only need: python3.9, numpy, pickle-mixin, and flask 

sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install sklearn
pip install seaborn
pip install pickle-mixin
pip install flask



****** For running the app

-Download the contents from the "app" folder and the "templates" folder

-You can run the app using flask, or using docker, bellow you can find the steps for each of them

-----Using flask:
-Inside the app folder from the shell run:

set FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run

-run localhost from the browser:
http://localhost:5000/

-to close the server, from the shell:
Ctrl + C

-----Using docker:
-You must be logged in to your docker user
-Inside the app folder from the shell run:
